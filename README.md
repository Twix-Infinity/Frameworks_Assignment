# Python Frameworks Assignment
Assignment Overview:
    This assignment will guide you through a basic analysis of the CORD-19 research dataset and creating a simple Streamlit application to display your findings. This simplified version focuses on fundamental data analysis skills appropriate for beginners.


Report of my findings:
    1. Publication Over Time: 
        The line plot of publications over time would likely show a sharp increase in the number of papers in the years 2020 and 2021, corresponding to the global spread of COVID-19. This demonstrates the rapid scientific response to the pandemic. 

    2. Top Publishing Journals: 
        The bar chart of the top journals would identify the leading academic publications in this field. It's expected to show major medical and scientific journals at the top, such as The Lancet or the New England Journal of Medicine, as they published a high volume of pandemic-related research.
        
        Most Common Words: An analysis of the most frequent words in paper titles would likely show terms like "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "virus", "pandemic", and "patients". This reflects the primary focus of the research within the dataset.

    3. Source Distribution: 
        The bar chart showing the distribution of papers by source would reveal which organizations or platforms (e.g., PubMed, Medline) are the primary contributors of the research papers in the dataset.


Reflect on challenges and learning:
    I specifically had a challenge with uploading the metadata.csv file on GitHub and Part 4, the Streamlit part. I kept getting this error:

                "C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python313\site-packages\pandas\core\indexes\base.py", line 3819, in get_loc
            raise KeyError(key) from err
        KeyError: 'publication_year'


    However, so far applying everything else I've learnt and the code executing itself flawlessly was very satisfying.
